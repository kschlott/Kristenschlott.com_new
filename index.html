          <p>My final semester as an undergraduate, I took a graduate-level architecture class as part of a cross-disciplinary initiative from the engineering school. It was my first experience with formal design theory, and ultimately set me squarely on the path towards becoming a designer, initially focused on sustainability-minded urban design. <br>

          <p>My team and I were charged to make an in-depth inquiry into the life and times of Lumbricus terrestris - the common earthworm.<br>  
          In short, the worm has hydrostatic skeleton, a large internal body cavity filled with fluid. In addition, it has a system of radial sphincter muscles which, when applied the volume of water they contain, affords its unique affinity for corporeal expansion or contraction, thus enabling it to burrow.<br>
          Inspired by this insight, we set about several months of experimentation and prototyping, which resulted in a final proposed application for this principle - a retractable rainwater catchment facade.</pr>

          <p> See above for select prototypes (concepts and fabrication by team), and the final proposal (as rendered by Kevin Murray).<br>
          Our facade is made of a matrix of individual modules - waterproof flexible pockets. <br> 
          The pockets are suspended from a rigid frame that is anchored at the top of a building’s face, but capable of expands linearly downward as the system fills with water.<br>
          At rest, the pockets, and thus the whole system, are devoid of water and at volumetric “zero”. During a rain event, water is funneled from the roof of the building into the top of the system. As water enters the top of the system, gravity accelerates it downwards to the bottom boundary of the system, whence the pockets fill to the volumetric maximum.<br>
          The corresponding weight of water triggers the system to expand linearly down the face of the building. Rows of pockets are subsequently filled from the bottom up, until both linear and volumetric expansion are complete, and the system is at capacity.<br>
          The system remains at capacity until water is taken out, for use by the building’s residents or directed back to the municipal storm water system at a time when burden on the system is lower.</p>

          <p> We proposed a solution that would address waste disposal in multi-unit residential buildings and commercial businesses. In short, a system of advanced shoots would separate compost and recycling from garbage, and runnel it into below-ground temporary storage. Garbage collection trucks would be retrofitted to access these storage areas from the street level.<br/>In addition, the system would include a smart bins + smart bill feature. Each building's refuse would be weighed, and rebates would be offered for customers with greater waste diversion. <br/>My role within the team was to specialize in data visualization, particularly working with GIS mapping software, as well as the detail design of our final presentation.</p>

It was modeled in GIS, finished in Adobe Illustrator and finally printed on 48'' canvas.<br>Some day I would love to create an interactive digital version,  perhaps as a tool to share ideas and adventure plans with friends, or just to keep track of your own "to do" list.</p>

          <p> To implement the targeted major-donor outreach strategy, on the back end I created a series of detailed donor reports using information from our CRM database. I used addresses to map donors and identify our top supporting cities, based on donor density. I then overlaid maps of where our major chapters were located, and found key target markets. </p>
          <ol>
            <li>1) The "big ask" was for donors to engage in an online auction we hosted. This photo was taken by Kris Jong at the auction item view / bid party I organized.</li>
            <li>2) I worked on both the first and second annual I Love Architecture campaigns, and designed the original logo that has been used since 2012.</li>
            <li>3) I reached out to 50+ renowned designers including Daniel Libeskind, David Adjaye, Fumihiko Maki, Jeanne Gang, Renzo Piano, Steven Holl and many many more, They donated original works, which we auctioned off on ebay to raise money. I layed out this promo piece, with thumbnails of top sketches.</li>

Conceptually, we're making a tool to help people understand the threat that climate change poses to their homes and businesses. People will come to the site, enter their address, and the search results will return a projected "risk" for their area, whether that be coastal or inland near rivers ("risk" metrics are a combination of the intensity and rate of water level rise). <br>We will then provide them with the tools to "take action," to share their data or message their local government representatives.

          <p>  Challenge #1 was to develop a search tool that did not rely on a potentially biased, user generated "tagging" system. For this we called upon researchers at Stanford to help analyze broadcast transcripts for content-based segments (e.g. state of the union, sports), that would logically relate to potential search terms. <br>Challenge #2 was conception and development of a new method for sharing unaltered content from the TV News archive. Thus, the Quote tool was born. Quote allows users to very simply select and share shorter (30 seconds or less) video clips, or "Quotes," from within a longer broadcast. Over time, any subsequent view / share activity is logged on the Quote's unique page much like a tumblr, spotlighting trends within various TV News topics.</p>
