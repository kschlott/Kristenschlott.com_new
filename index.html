          <p>My final semester as an undergraduate, I took a graduate-level architecture class as part of a cross-disciplinary initiative from the engineering school. It was my first experience with formal design theory, and ultimately set me squarely on the path towards becoming a designer, initially focused on sustainability-minded urban design. <br>

          <p>My team and I were charged to make an in-depth inquiry into the life and times of Lumbricus terrestris - the common earthworm.<br>  
          In short, the worm has hydrostatic skeleton, a large internal body cavity filled with fluid. In addition, it has a system of radial sphincter muscles which, when applied the volume of water they contain, affords its unique affinity for corporeal expansion or contraction, thus enabling it to burrow.<br>
          Inspired by this insight, we set about several months of experimentation and prototyping, which resulted in a final proposed application for this principle - a retractable rainwater catchment facade.</pr>

          <p> See above for select prototypes (concepts and fabrication by team), and the final proposal (as rendered by Kevin Murray).<br>
          Our facade is made of a matrix of individual modules - waterproof flexible pockets. <br> 
          The pockets are suspended from a rigid frame that is anchored at the top of a building’s face, but capable of expands linearly downward as the system fills with water.<br>
          At rest, the pockets, and thus the whole system, are devoid of water and at volumetric “zero”. During a rain event, water is funneled from the roof of the building into the top of the system. As water enters the top of the system, gravity accelerates it downwards to the bottom boundary of the system, whence the pockets fill to the volumetric maximum.<br>
          The corresponding weight of water triggers the system to expand linearly down the face of the building. Rows of pockets are subsequently filled from the bottom up, until both linear and volumetric expansion are complete, and the system is at capacity.<br>
          The system remains at capacity until water is taken out, for use by the building’s residents or directed back to the municipal storm water system at a time when burden on the system is lower.</p>

          <p>We were prompted to propose any "feasible green solution" for an urban issue in downtown Berkeley, giving consideration to the guidelines set out in Berkeley's Climate Action Plan and SB 375.<br> In order to achieve the 2020 zero waste goal outlined in the Climate Action Plan, we felt it vital to address the inefficiencies of composting and recycling within commercial businesses and multi-family residential units, especially given the rapid rate of population growth the area was experiencing.

          <p> We proposed a solution that would address waste disposal in multi-unit residential buildings and commercial businesses. In short, a system of advanced shoots would separate compost and recycling from garbage, and runnel it into below-ground temporary storage. Garbage collection trucks would be retrofitted to access these storage areas from the street level.<br/>In addition, the system would include a smart bins + smart bill feature. Each building's refuse would be weighed, and rebates would be offered for customers with greater waste diversion. <br/>My role within the team was to specialize in data visualization, particularly working with GIS mapping software, as well as the detail design of our final presentation.</p>

            <li>2) I worked on both the first and second annual I Love Architecture campaigns, and designed the original logo that has been used since 2012.</li>
            <li>3) I reached out to 50+ renowned designers including Daniel Libeskind, David Adjaye, Fumihiko Maki, Jeanne Gang, Renzo Piano, Steven Holl and many many more, They donated original works, which we auctioned off on ebay to raise money. I layed out this promo piece, with thumbnails of top sketches.</li>

          <p> For the annual "What Do You See?" campaign, I worked on a microsite and a video, link above. I co-managed the production process, and the video was produced by Ravel Creative and Hamilton Gordon with illustrations by Johanne Vestergaard, Karl Johnson, Michael Steiner and myself. <br>Web development was by Albatross Digital with all content and additional UI design by myself. <br>I worked particularly closely on UI for the microsite. We needed something that could also serve to be used for future fundraisers and campaigns. </p>

          <p>I recently joined some friends of mine on a project, tentatively called "Sunk Investment." Conceptually, we're making a tool to help people understand the threat that climate change poses to their homes and businesses. People will come to the site, enter their address, and the search results will return a projected "risk" for their area, whether that be coastal or inland near rivers ("risk" metrics are a combination of the intensity and rate of water level rise). <br>We will then provide them with the tools to "take action," to share their data or message their local government representatives.

          <p>  Challenge #1 was to develop a search tool that did not rely on a potentially biased, user generated "tagging" system. For this we called upon researchers at Stanford to help analyze broadcast transcripts for content-based segments (e.g. state of the union, sports), that would logically relate to potential search terms. <br>Challenge #2 was conception and development of a new method for sharing unaltered content from the TV News archive. Thus, the Quote tool was born. Quote allows users to very simply select and share shorter (30 seconds or less) video clips, or "Quotes," from within a longer broadcast. Over time, any subsequent view / share activity is logged on the Quote's unique page much like a tumblr, spotlighting trends within various TV News topics.</p>
